# Exercise 2.20 Repeating, breaking and remembering

Next, we'll implement a program one piece at a time. This is always strongly recommended when coding.

The series of exercises form a larger program whose functionality is implemented in small pieces. If you do not finish the whole series, you can still submit the parts you've completed to be checked. Although the submission system complains about the tests of unfinished parts, you get points for the parts you have finished.

## Reading

Implement a program that asks the user for numbers (the program first prints "Write numbers: ") until the user gives the number -1. When the user writes -1, the program prints "Thx! Bye!" and ends.

```plaintext
Give numbers:
**5**
Give numbers:
**2**
Give numbers:
**4**
Give numbers:
**-1**
Thx! Bye!
```

## Sum of numbers

Extend the program so that it prints the sum of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.

```plaintext
Give numbers:
**5**
**2**
**4**
**-1**
Thx! Bye!
Sum: 11
```


## Sum and the number of numbers

Extend the program so that it also prints the number of numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.

```plaintext
Give numbers:
**5**
**2**
**4**
**-1**
Thx! Bye!
Sum: 11
Numbers: 3
```

## Average of numbers

Extend the program so that it prints the mean of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.

```plaintext
Give numbers:
**5**
**2**
**4**
**-1**
Thx! Bye!
Sum: 11
Numbers: 3
Average: 3.666666666666
```


## Even and odd numbers

Extend the program so that it prints the number of even and odd numbers (excluding the -1).

```plaintext
Give numbers:
**5**
**2**
**4**
**-1**
Thx! Bye!
Sum: 11
Numbers: 3
Average: 3.666666666666
Even: 2
Odd: 1
```
